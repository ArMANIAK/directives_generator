# Quick Directives generator

This application allows to quickly generate clauses of directives which are connected with movements of personnel such as sick leaves, business trips, etc.

Although it demands a whole lot of work to fill the dictionaries at the beginning later on it gives a benefit in time spent on typing those clauses on daily basis.

After pressin "Generate directive" clauses will be copied to a clipboard

You can create the production app using `npm run dist`.
